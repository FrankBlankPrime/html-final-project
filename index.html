                <h3>Birth and Early Life</h3>
                <p>Frank was born on <time datetime="1995-07-17">July 17, 1995</time> in the gorgeous Appalachian
                    Mountains.
                    He was born the 3<sup>rd</sup> son and 4<sup>th</sup> child of his family, having 2 older brothers
                    and
                    an older (<s>by 2 minutes</s>) sister.</p>
                <p>
                    While he may have been born a shy child, it didn't take very long for that to change. By age 4 Frank
                    was as loud and lively as could be imagined, a trait he still maintains to this very day. Even
                    throughout
                    several dark hours in his early life, be they medical issues, the loss of loved ones, or a
                    melancholy mixture
                    of the two, Frank always strived to try and greet the day with a smile on his face.
                </p>
                <h3>School Years and Childhood</h3>
                <p>
                    As Frank entered school age he would quickly come to fine an immense joy in education. From the
                    moment he stepped
                    foot in the classroom, there was no stopping him. School was a place that he found comfort, and
                    solace.
                    He may not have been the most athletic, or the most popular, but behind a desk or in the pages of a
                    book he found his
                    stride and more. Be it science, or math, or even grammar, he would always look forward to what more
                    could be learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few years in school, Frank began to branch out into more than just academics, beginning his
                    music education
                    in the 6<sup>th</sup> grade and taking up the euphonium for the first time. He, like most other
                    people in the world, didn't
                    know what a euphonium was at the time, but as soon as his lips touched the mouthpiece for the first
                    time, he knew
                    that it was something he was meant to play.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't until several years later that Frank would realy understand just how important of a
                        role a euphonium
                        played in a given ensemble, and it would be several years more before he realized just how
                        poetic it was that,
                        of all of the instruments in the world, he had found his way to that one. The great musician and
                        composer
                        <cite><a target="_blank"
                                href="https://quotefancy.com/quote/1422385/John-Philip-Sousa-A-band-is-only-as-good-as-its-euphonium-section">John
                                Philip Sousa</a></cite> said it best:
                    <blockquote>"A band is only as good as its <mark>euphonium</mark> section"</blockquote>
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <h3>Musical Training</h3>
                <p>
                    Music had been a part of Frank's life for as long as he could remember. Whether it was his father
                    introducing him to
                    The Beatles as a child, him singing along to cartoon opening themes, or even just tapping on his
                    legs to a rhythm that
                    he made up, he caught the music bug and he caught it bad. It wasn't until he was started in middle
                    school band that he
                    really learned what he could do with this talent. He learned how to play the euphonium, and how to
                    read sheet music, and
                    it was like an entirely new world had been opened up to him. He could finally put into notation what
                    had been in his head
                    for so many years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After so many years of performing in concert band and marching band (his favorite) he learned how to
                    conduct and began to really hone
                    his musicianship to a degree he had never thought he could achieve before. It wasn't until he was
                    accepted into an undergraduate
                    music program that he was actually able to realize just how far he had come, and even moreso how
                    much further he had to go.

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                </summary>
                <h3>High School Education</h3>
                <p>Frank attended Union High School in Big Stone Gap Virginia from <time datetime="2009-08">August
                        2009</time>
                    to <time datetime="2013-05">May 2013</time> where he graduated 3<sup>rd</sup> in his class of 144
                    students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time graduation rolled around all Frank could think about was how excited he was, both to put
                    this chapter of his life behind him, and to greet the next chapter head on. As far as he was
                    concerned,
                    college was going to be where he could finaly be himself; where life could finally begin.

                    <h3>College Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        Frank attended Virginia Tech for his undergraduate studies from <time datetime="2013-08">August
                            2013</time> to <time datetime="2016-12">December 2016</time>.
                    </p>
                    <aside>
                        <p>
                            While Virginia Tech is the most commonly known name, the school's <em>full</em> name is:
                            Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
                        </p>
                    </aside>
                    <p>
                        Originally attending school to study music with the hope of becoming a band director,
                        Frank obtained his Bachelor's of Science in Psychology (In just 3.5 years!). While this may
                        have been his main course of study, his time in school was one rife with several varied
                        and exciting experiences. He discovered a joy for writing poetry, discussing philosophy,
                        and several other mildly pretentious things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from a stereotypical education, Frank's time in college also taught him a lot about
                        himself. Things the he loved about who he was, things that were new, and things that made him
                        squirm a bit when he looked at himself in the mirror. This is where he came into his own as a
                        young queer man. Where he discovered his polyamorous nature and learned just how quickly and
                        intensly he can love. Unfortunately its also the place where he learned just how intense the
                        darkness inside of him could truly be, and how much work he needed to do to learn to calm it.

                    <h3>Post College</h3>
                    <p>
                        While Frank did originally intend to pursue a doctoral degree after graduating with his
                        <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BS</abbr> in Psychology, he would ultimately decide to hold
                        off on this plan to try and establish himself in the world. He moved to Houston, TX in order to
                        see more of the world and to distance himself from where he grew up. Despite not continuing on
                        to higher education, Frank's adult life would be a constant stream of learning new things:
                        things
                        about life, about love, and about himself.

                <p>
                    Frank has had several interests and hobbies throughout his life; some relatively common,
                    others a bit more esoteric:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Swords</dt>
                    <dd>Like so many young boys, Frank developed a fascination for swords and all kinds
                        of bladed weapons at an early age, the most notable of which? The Katana
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Music</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Music has been a huge part of Frank's life, from age 11 or 12 up to the current day.
                        While he may not perform like he used to, this is still a very integral part of
                        his life

                    <dd>
                        While he may not be a smith himself, Frank has always held a fascination for the
                        smithing arts. The technique, the artistry, and results, all of it holds a special
                        place in Frank's mind.
                        <aside>Fun Fact - Frank has often been quoted as saying <i>"If I had an eccentric
                                rich person hobby, it would be blacksmithing."</i>
