                        Fun Fact: Frank was in the running the be the valedictorian of his graduating class,
                        however he decided that he wanted to focus on enjoying his senior year instead of it
                        becoming
                        something of a grind, so he settled for 3<sup>rd</sup> place instead.

                        While Frank was in his highschool years, he also honed his musical talents, and the biggest
                        and most prominent way to express his progress as a musician was to audition for and
                        participate
                        in honor band clinics. Throughout his years as a student musician Frank auditioned and
                        participated
                        in several of these clinics. However the crux of these achievements are when he auditioned
                        for
                        and obtained First Chair in both the county honor band in <time datetime="2012-10">October

                        An honor band clinic is where several student musicians spend a chosen weekend doing nothing
                        but working with a guest conductor to prepare and rehearse several (often difficult or
                        advanced)
                        pieces of music to be performed at the end of the weekend.

                        Towards the end of his highschool career, Frank decided that he wanted to pursue
                        music in a professional capacity. In <time datetime="2013-02">February of 2013</time>
                        he traveled to Blacksburg, VA to audition for a spot in the music education program
                        at Virginia Tech. He would find out several months later that he was successful in this
                        endeavor; not only cementing his place in higher education, but the arts as well.

                        Frank's time in university was one riddled with ups, downs, and everything in between.
                        In the summer of 2016, Frank made the (potentially stupid) decision to take 18 credit
                        hours over the break. It was hard, arduous work, however he was successful. This allowed
                        Frank to graduate a semester early, officially earning his <abbr

                        For years, Frank has dreamed of becoming, as the youth would say, buff.
                        Despite his aspirations of being physically thicc, several factors would often
                        prevent Frank from making this goal of his a reality. However, in
                        <time datetime="2025-08">August of 2025</time> Frank was finally able to commit to
                        improving his physical health.

                        As previously mentioned, his mental health was always something of a pain point for Frank
                        throughout his life. However in <time datetime="2024-07">July of 2024</time>, after a series
                        of
                        rather substantial setbacks, Frank decided to firmly take his mental well-being in his own
                        hands.
                        The road has been long, and it will never truly end, but this is certainly an achievement he
                        has
                        found worthy of chasing.
